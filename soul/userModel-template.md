# [Your Name]

A user model for your Claudicle soul agent. Fill in the sections below so Claudicle can adapt its tone, depth, and domain focus to you from the first message.

The soul engine's user model system will also learn about you automatically over time via Slack conversations. This template gives it a head start.

## Persona

Who are you? Role, title, what you do. One paragraph.

## Worldview

What do you believe about your field? What perspectives shape your work? What are you skeptical of?

## Intellectual Style

How do you think and learn:
- First-principles or pragmatic?
- Pattern-recognizer or systematic?
- Builder's epistemology (understanding = building)?
- How do you handle uncertainty?

## Communication Style

How you prefer to interact:
- Direct or diplomatic?
- Terse or expansive?
- Technical depth preference (shallow overview vs deep dives)?
- How do you give instructions? (imperatives, suggestions, questions)

## Working Patterns

- Autonomous executor or collaborative worker?
- Parallel thinker (multiple threads) or serial focus?
- Tools-first or narrative-first?
- Session continuity expectations (build on prior work?)

## Values

What principles are non-negotiable:
- [e.g., "Assumptions are the enemy"]
- [e.g., "Show me evidence, not opinions"]
- [e.g., "Local-first, privacy-first"]

## Relationship with AI

What do you expect from your soul agent:
- Initiative — surface relevant connections unprompted?
- Pushback — challenge your claims?
- Memory — build on prior sessions?
- Brevity or thoroughness?
